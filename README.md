## Work on project. Stage 3/4: I'm so lite

### Description
You can use the sqlite3 module to manage SQLite databases from Python. 
You don't need to install this module. It is included in the standard library.

To use the module, you must first create a Connection object that represents the database. 
Here the data will be stored in the example.s3db file:

```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.s3db')
```

Once you have a ```Connection```, you can create a ```Cursor``` object and call its ```execute()``` method to perform SQL queries:

```python
cur = conn.cursor()

# Executes some SQL query
cur.execute('SOME SQL QUERY')

# After making some changes in DB don't forget to commit them!
conn.commit()
```

To get data returned by the SELECT query you can use the methods ```fetchone()``` and ```fetchall()```:

```python
cur.execute('SOME SELECT QUERY')

# Returns the first row from the response
cur.fetchone()

# Returns all rows from the response
cur.fetchall()
```

### Objectives

In this stage, create a database named ```card.s3db``` with a table titled ```card```. It should have the following columns:

- id INTEGER
- number TEXT
- pin TEXT
- balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0

Pay attention: your database file should be created when the program starts if it hasnâ€™t yet been created. 
And all created cards should be stored in the database from now.

Do not forget to commit your DB changes right after executing a query!

#### Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (>) represents the user input.

```shell

Your card has been created
Your card number:
4000003429795087
Your card PIN:
